# Pytest REST API Automation Framework

This repository contains a modular, maintainable, and scalable API testing framework built with Python + Pytest. It is designed to test REST APIs with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), while supporting:

âœ… Config-driven architecture (base URLs, tokens, headers in config.yaml)

âœ… Reusable API client (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

âœ… Schema validation & assertions

âœ… Centralized error handling & logging

âœ… Detailed reports (Allure / HTML)

âœ… CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions ready)
