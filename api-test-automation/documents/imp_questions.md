ðŸ“Œ Difference Between Request Headers and Response Headers
1. Request Headers

Sent by the client (you / your test / browser / API client) to the server.

Purpose: Provide additional information to the server about the request.

Examples:

Authorization: Pass authentication tokens or API keys.

Content-Type: Tells the server the format of data being sent (application/json, application/xml, multipart/form-data, etc.).

User-Agent: Identifies the client making the request (browser, Postman, Python requests, etc.).

Accept: Informs the server what content types the client can handle in the response (application/json, text/html, etc.).

ðŸ“Œ Example (Request Header):

POST /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: reqres.in
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

2. Response Headers

Sent by the server back to the client along with the response body.

Purpose: Provide metadata about the response.

Examples:

Content-Type: Format of the response (application/json, text/html, etc.).

Set-Cookie: Sends cookies to the client for session handling.

Cache-Control: Tells how the response can be cached.

Date: Timestamp of when the response was generated.

Server: Info about the server (e.g., nginx, Apache).

ðŸ“Œ Example (Response Header):

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Tue, 27 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT
Server: nginx
Cache-Control: no-cache


âœ… Simple Analogy:
Think of ordering food at a restaurant:

Request Headers = What you tell the waiter (vegetarian, spicy, payment method).

Response Headers = What the waiter tells you with the dish (this is vegetarian, cooked at 12 PM, no refills allowed).
